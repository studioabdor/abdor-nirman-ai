# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
Coding Standards and Guidelines

    Code Structure & Modularity:
        When generating new components or features, I will aim to create separate files and place them in the appropriate folders (/components, /features).
        I will suggest creating reusable utility functions when I identify duplicate code or common tasks.
        I will respect and maintain the defined folder structure.

    Coding Standards:
        I will use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components in the code I generate.
        I will strive to keep functions small and focused on a single task.
        I will add comments to explain complex logic and encourage you to maintain the documentation files (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md).
        I will adhere to consistent code formatting. While I don't directly run linters, I will follow common style conventions.

    State Management & Data Flow:
        When generating components, I will use useState for local component state.
        For shared data, I will suggest using appropriate global state management solutions (e.g., Context API).
        When interacting with Firebase, I will aim to use the recommended SDK or hooks.

    Error Handling & Debugging:
        I will include try...catch blocks in the code I generate for API calls and critical operations.
        I will use console.error for logging errors and suggest implementing a more robust logging system if needed.
        I will encourage you to write tests and provide guidance on using testing libraries.

    Version Control & Collaboration:
        While I don't directly interact with Git, I understand the importance of version control and will generate code that is compatible with a Git workflow.
        I will provide clear and descriptive explanations of the code changes I make, which can be used as a basis for commit messages.
        I will be ready to assist with code reviews by providing feedback on code quality, adherence to standards, and potential issues.

    Maintaining Context & Chain of Thought:
        I will refer to the project documentation (if available) to understand the context and goals.
        I will pay attention to contextual comments in the code.
        I will respond to your prompts based on the specific context you provide.
